# Block Master
Falling block puzzle game for Grand Masters

## About
This project was started in an attempt to learn more about game programming with Python and pygame.
It aims to be an open source implementation of the [Tetris The Grand Master][tgmwiki] series of games.
Initially it will focus on emulating TGM1 functionality well, before adding all the bells and whistles.
It was based on the great [Tetris tutorial on techwithtim.net][tutorial], with lots of improvements and features to make it behave more like TGM1.
There's still a long way to go but it's slowly getting there. It was initially a private repo, but I haven't worked on it in a while so I decided to make it public anyway.

Currently the only requirement is Python 3.7+ and pygame.
